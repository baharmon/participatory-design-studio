**Course description**
In this studio you will design and develop serious games
that explore the challenges of coastal change
for the town of Jean Lafitte in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.
These games will use
[Tangible Landscape](http://tangible-landscape.github.io/) -
a tangible interface for GIS -
to model, simulate, and visualize alternative future scenarios.
The games will address the impact of coastal change -
of storm surge, flooding, erosion, and land-loss -
on Jean Lafitte.
The games will explore how methods for defense or adaptation
such as evacuation, levee construction, elevated buildings, floating buildings,
and bioretention wetlands
perform in simulated storms.
You will  run a serious gaming workshop
for the community in Jean Lafitte
and another for the LSU College of Art and Design.
