**Course description**
In this studio you will design and develop serious games
that explore the challenges of coastal change
for the town of Jean Lafitte in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.
These games will use
[Tangible Landscape](http://tangible-landscape.github.io/) -
a tangible interface for GIS -
to model, simulate, and visualize alternative future scenarios.
The games will address the impact of coastal change -
of storm surge, flooding, erosion, and land-loss -
on Jean Lafitte.
The games will explore how methods for defense or adaptation
such as levee construction, elevated buildings, floating buildings,
and bioretention wetlands
perform in simulated storms.
You will  run a serious gaming workshop
for the community in Jean Lafitte
and another for the LSU College of Art and Design.
