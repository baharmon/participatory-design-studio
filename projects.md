# Projects
In **groups of 3 or 4**
you will design and implement a serious game
exploring the challenges facing Jean Lafitte.

**Topics**
* Storm surge and relative sea level rise
* Stormwater management
* Riverine flooding
* Evacuation routes
* Tourism
* Art installation

A storm surge game might explore scenarios with
the current levees, with new levees, or without levees.
It might also explore different flood levels
due to storm surge and relative sea level rise.
Scores may be based on buildings flooded,
construction costs, etc.

A stormwater management game might address a neighborhood scale
with streetside bioswales, bioretention ponds, and planting
or even a household scale with the design of a single garden.
A stormwater management game may address
flood mitigation or erosion control.
**Recommended!**

A riverine flood game might address the spatial configuration of
levees, retention ponds, canals, marshes, and diversions.
Such a game would require a sophisticated flood simulation
such as ITZI. Only for the brave!

An evacuation game may address the best paths for
evacuation routes and best sites for shelters.

A tourism game may address new wetland trails, viewpoints,
and planting design.
Or it might address a gateway experience to the town,
streetscape design, and civic sculpture.

Or you can surprise me with an interactive art installation
that challenges how the community
thinks about land, water, and time.
This would need to be interactive, engaging,
deeply thought provoking, and beautifully executed.

Games may address multiple scales.
They may have multiple stages or steps.
Games should not only address risks, but
also factors such as aesthetics
(ie. how beautiful the town could look)
and the cultural connection to the waterfront.

**Data & Submissions**
There is GIS data for the project on the course network drive
at `\\desn-knox.lsu.edu\Landscape-Classes\LA-7061` on Windows
or `smb://desn-knox.lsu.edu/Landscape-Classes/LA-7061` on Mac.
Upload digital copies of your finished work to the class network drive.

## Maps
Each group will design, plot, and pin-up
at least 3 maps.
The maps should should
introduce the town of Jean Lafitte and its surroundings
and
explain challenges and risks the town faces.
The maps should be at at multiple scales
and may include graphs, charts, diagrams, and photomontage
to show processes over time or the character of a place.
Revised versions of these maps will be part
of the posters presented at the final workshops.

Possible topics for the maps include:
* Reference maps that show where the site is, what its context is, and key buildings and structures
* Socio-cultural maps about character, demographics, history, structures, etc.
* Environmental maps about topography, ecosystems, hydrology, coastal erosion, etc.
* Environmental maps about long-term processes such as relative sea level rise and land loss
* Risks maps about historic hurricane paths, historic flooding, flood risks, etc.
* Planning maps about proposed interventions such as sediment diversions, building elevation, levees, marsh restoration, etc.

**Due:** Wednesday, Jan 31

## Storyboards
Each group will pin-up and present sketches
illustrating their idea for a game.
They should explain the concept, challenges addressed,
gameplay, rules, and interactions.
Groups should also explain their design process and
show some of the other ideas they have brainstormed.
Finally each group should discuss how they plan
implement their game.

**Due: Friday, Feb 16**

## Physical models
Each group will make a hollow CNC-milled
terrain model of the town in high density foam
at a scale of their choice.
The milled models will be used to cast sand models
for the group's game.
Each group will also 3D print the town's buildings.

**Due:**

**Grade:** 20%

## Games
Each group will design and develop a game
using Tangible Landscape.
Their game will explore a set of scenarios
for coastal change, defense, and adaptation.
Games should have clear objectives, rules, and scores.
Groups will write simple Python scripts to automate their game,
fabricate any game pieces needed,
and play test a working prototype of their game.

There will be a series of special workshops on
3D modeling and rendering with Tangible Landscape
on March 5, 7, & 9 by a guest lecturer.

**Due:**

**Grade:** 20%

## Booklet
Each group will prepare a booklet for the serious gaming workshops
that describes the challenges of coastal change
and explains the rules of the game.
The booklets should include a survey
for participants to complete.

**Due:**

**Grade:** 20%

## Posters
Each group will design and print posters
for the serious gaming workshops.
The posters should
include maps and imagery of Jean Lafitte,
maps and visualizations of
coastal change scenarios for the town,
and introduce their game.

**Due:**

**Grade:** 20%

## Workshops
All of the groups will present their games at
a community workshop in Jean Lafitte
and another workshop at the LSU College of Design.
In the workshop participants will play the games
and develop their own design solutions.

**Due:**

**Grade:** 20%
